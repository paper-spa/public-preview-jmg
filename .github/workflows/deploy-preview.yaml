#
# Expected repository setup
#
# 1. Pages is enabled and tracking a branch that does not contain anything
# 2. The `github-pages` environment has been created and is protected (either via the "Selected branches" or "Protected branches" options)
# 3. The repository is an actor on this feature flag: https://admin.github.com/devtools/feature_flags/pages_preview_deployments
#

#
# Triggers
